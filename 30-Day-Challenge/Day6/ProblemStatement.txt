How Much Big Is Your Number (100 Marks)
For this challenge, you will take an integer input from stdin, store it in a variable and  calculate the number of digits in the 
number using division operator.

Input Format
A single integer value to be taken as input from stdin and stored it in a variable of your choice. 

Constraints
1 < = n < = 18

Output Format
Print the value which you will get after calculating the number of digits. 

Sample TestCase 1
Input
34567
Output
5
Explanation
Every time you divide the input number by 10, one digit get reduced and you need to maintain a count of that until the input number 
reduced to 0. The count value is your answer.
34567/10 = 3456 count = 1
3456/10 = 345 count = 2
345/10 = 34 count = 3
34/10 = 3 count = 4
3/10 = 0 count = 5
