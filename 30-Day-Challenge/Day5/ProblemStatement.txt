Loop your world (100 Marks)
For this challenge, you need to take an integer value as input from stdin, calculate its factorial and print the result to the stdout.

Input Format
A single integer value to be taken as input from stdin and stored it in a variable of your choice. 

Constraints
1 < = n < = 15

Output Format
Print the value which you will get after calculating the factorial of the input. 

Sample TestCase 1
Input
5
Output
120
Explanation
For a number, we will calculate its factorial by multiplying the number with the numbers which comes between 1(inclusive) and the 
number itself.
For input as 5, its factorial will be 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.
factorial of n (n!) = 1*2*3*4....n
